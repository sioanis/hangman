Hangman:
- [x] Start game by entering a word into a text box.
- [x] Display an underscore for each letter of the word.
- [x] Enter a letter guess into another textbox and submit by clicking a button.
- [x] Whenever a correct guess is made, reveal the letter in the word by replacing the corresponding underscore.
- [x] Whenever a wrong guess is made, draw another piece of the hangman.  To save time, you can just decrement a "Remaining Guesses" counter instead of actually drawing a hangman.
- [x] If you guess the word display a "You win!" alert, otherwise display a "You lose!" alert.

Layout:
- [x] Fixed position header and footer which span the entire width of the page.
- [x] 4 columns for desktop resolutions, 2 columns for portrait tablet, and 1 column for phone.
- [x] Column 1 should contain an ordered list of 10 items with alternating background colors.
- [x] Column 2 should contain a div with 5px rounded corners.
- [x] Column 3 should contain a div with horizontally and vertically centered text which spans multiple lines.
- [x] Column 4 should contain and image which takes up the full width of the column.
- [x] Cross-browser compatible.  IE9+.  Graceful degradation for IE8 where appropriate.
